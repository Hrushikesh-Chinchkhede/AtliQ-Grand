# AtliQ-Grand
Python Project - AtliQ Grand Data Analysis!

I had the privilege of analyzing AtliQ Grands' hotel operations, a luxury hotel chain in India, using Python under the guidance of Dhaval Patel. This project focused on uncovering insights and providing strategic recommendations to help regain market share and revenue.

 Project Overview:
AtliQ Grands, a leading player in the luxury hotel industry, has been facing declining market share due to rising competition and internal challenges. The goal of the project was to extract data-driven insights to help the company make strategic decisions.

 Tools Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (groupby, merge, describe)
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, line plots)
NumPy: For handling numerical data and calculating metrics like occupancy rates

Data Analysis Process:

Data Import & Exploration: Imported datasets and conducted an initial review to evaluate data quality.
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies to ensure accurate analysis.
Data Transformation: Merged datasets and created new metrics, such as occupancy percentage, to extract deeper insights.
Data Insights & Visualization: Key trends related to revenue, occupancy rates, and booking patterns were visualized for a better understanding.
 Key Insights:

The average occupancy rate is 58.40%.
Guests have an average rating of 3.61.
The booking cancellation rate stands at 24.83%.
Mumbai leads in revenue with ₹668.57M, while Delhi follows at ₹294.40M.
The Luxury category generates ₹1052.57M in revenue, outperforming the Business category at ₹655.97M.
 Recommendations:

Increase Delhi’s Revenue: Focus on enhancing guest experience and pricing strategies where occupancy is high but revenue lags.
Promote Weekend Stays: Introduce packages to take advantage of higher weekend occupancy.
Reduce Cancellations: Implement stricter policies and offer incentives to lower the booking cancellation rate.
